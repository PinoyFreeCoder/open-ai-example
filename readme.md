# Getting Started

Welcome to the PinoyFreeCoder's OpenAI Example repository! This repository contains code examples that demonstrate how to use OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate natural language text.
Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you'll need to have an OpenAI API key. If you don't already have an API key, you can sign up for one on the OpenAI website.

After setting your API key, you can clone this repository and install the required Node.js packages:

```
git clone https://github.com/PinoyFreeCoder/open-ai-example.git
cd open-ai-example
npm install
```

## Creating .env
Once you have an API key, you'll need to set it as an environment variable on your project using .env and set your api key

```
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

```

## Running the app

To run the app on your local machine and access it on your web browser via http://localhost:3000
